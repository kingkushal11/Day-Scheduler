# Day-Scheduler

## Description
In this project, I made a day planner where the users could write their tasks. Users can open the website where the date is shown at the top of the page and it allows users to save their events for each hour. Their tasks will not be erased if they refresh the page. The color shows whether it is the past, future, or present. The grey color means it's past, the green color means future, and the red means present.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
